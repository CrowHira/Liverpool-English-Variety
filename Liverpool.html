        <h2>Language Status</h2>
        <p>In Liverpool, English is the mother tongue and the primary language spoken by the majority of the population. As with the rest of the United Kingdom, English holds the status of the official language in Liverpool. This means that government, education, and official communication are conducted in English.

            Liverpool, being part of the UK, does not have its own official language separate from the national language policies. However, English in Liverpool may be spoken with a distinct local accent and include regional vocabulary and expressions, such as those found in Liverpool English or Scouse.
            
            As for being a lingua franca, within the local community and among native English speakers, English serves as the common language for everyday communication. However, due to its history as a port city with a diverse population, Liverpool may also have residents who speak languages other than English, reflecting the multicultural nature of the city. In these cases, individuals may use English as a lingua franca for intercultural communication.</p>

    <section id="pronunciation">
        <h2>Pronunciation</h2>
        <p>Liverpool English has distinct pronunciation features that set it apart from standard varieties like Received Pronunciation (RP) in the UK or General American in the US. Here are some notable differences:
            <p>1. Vowel Sounds:
               - The vowel sound in words like "goat" or "coat" is often pronounced with a distinct Scouse accent, where it may sound closer to "gut" or "cut."
               - The "u" sound in words like "bus" may be pronounced more like "boos."
            
               <p> 2. Consonant Sounds:
               - The dropping of the "h" sound at the beginning of words is common, so "house" might be pronounced as "ouse."
               - The "r" sound is often pronounced with a slight roll or tapped sound, especially at the end of words.
            
               <p> 3. Intonation and Stress:
               - Scouse has a unique intonation pattern, and stress on syllables may differ from standard English. This can affect the rhythm and flow of speech.
            
               <p>  4. Diphthongization:
               - Certain diphthongs are pronounced differently. For instance, the diphthong in words like "price" might be pronounced more like "proice."
            
               <p>  5. Nasalization:
               - Some vowels may be nasalized, particularly before nasal consonants. This can be heard in words like "thing" or "long."
            
               <p>  6. Softening Consonants:
               - Consonants, especially "t" and "d," can be softened or even dropped in the middle or end of words. For example, "water" may sound more like "wah-er."
            
               <p>  7. Shortened Vowels:
               - Some vowel sounds may be shortened, leading to words like "happy" sounding more like "happeh."
            
               <p> Comparing these features to Received Pronunciation or General American, it's clear that Liverpool English has a distinctive set of sounds and pronunciations. The Scouse accent is often considered lively and friendly, contributing to the rich linguistic tapestry of Liverpool.
